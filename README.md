# Installing OpenAI baseline

Go to https://github.com/openai/baselines/ and install following the instructions.

If the instructions don't work, just do `git clone https://github.com/openai/baselines/` and then set your `PYTHONPATH` in your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bash_rc` to point to the `baselines` folder.
